# [L-1] User can bypass the _leverageCheck and open a long position with 1x leverage

The contract uses a boolean variable `_long` to identify whether a user opens a long or a short position. If it is true, the user opens a long position; if it is false, the user opens a short position. However, there is a way for a user to open a long position with 1x leverage, which is not allowed by the design of the protocol. The user can do this by calling `sellAllAmountWithLeverage` and swapping the `asset` and `quote` arguments. This will set the `_long` argument to `false` and pass the `_leverageCheck` even though the user is effectively opening a long position with 1x leverage.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

This exploit violates the design of the protocol and may have unintended consequences for the market dynamics and the user experience. However, it does not cause any loss of funds for the protocol or the users. The protocol team could consider removing the `_leverageCheck` or adding additional checks to prevent this exploit.

# [L-2] Critical Address Changes Should Use Two-step Procedure

The function setOwner() transfer ownership to a new address. In case a wrong address is supplied ownership is inaccessible.

Instance:

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Lack of two-step procedure for critical operations leaves them error-prone. Consider adding two-step procedure on the critical functions.

# [L-3] Emit events in important operations

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add events to above critical functions.

# [L-4] Relying on setters for initialisation of critical parameters is risky

Critical contract parameters should have a fail-safe default value enforced during declaration or in constructor/initialize functions without relying on admin-controlled setters to be called. Missed timely calling of such setters may result in type-dependent default values which could be dangerous because default value may be unexpected for the protocol.

In this case `rewardsDuration` parameter has no default value.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/9ca03938f21aa8c5f439bc360d68cb9516d893af/contracts/periphery/BathBuddy.sol#L232-L242


## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add default value when initilizing the variable.

# [L-5] Low test coverage

Test coverage is 60% which is low. Only the main path is coverage, not the edge cases.

        - What is the overall line coverage percentage provided by your tests?:  60%

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/511636d889742296a54392875a35e4c0c4727bb7/README.md#L173

Tool used: 

npx hardhat coverage

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Ensure the coverage report produced via `npx hardhat coverage` covers all functions within the smart contract suite.

# [N-2] Add parameter to Event-Emit

The event `emitFee` should have an additional parameter called recipient, because the fee can be received by either the owner or the recipient. If the owner = address(0), the recipient address is lost in the event.

# [N-5] Remove unused functions and modifier related to close and stop

The contract does not have any logic related to closing or stopping. The function `isClosed` always returns `false` and does not affect any other function. Therefore, it should be removed.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/9ca03938f21aa8c5f439bc360d68cb9516d893af/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L620-L622

Similarly, the state variable `stopped` and the function `stop()` have no effect on the contractâ€™s behavior and should be deleted.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/9ca03938f21aa8c5f439bc360d68cb9516d893af/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L594

# [N-6] Simplify code by removing matchingEnabled and buyEnable

The state variable `matchingEnabled` and `buyEnable` always true and cannot be modified by any function. Therefore, they are unnecessary and can be removed. The condition checks related to `matchingEnabled` can also be deleted to simplify the code. Each unnecessary condition in code can lead to more cases and bugs

`matchingEnabled`:

# [N-8] Remove contract note

This contract has the sole purpose of emitting events dynamically. However, it is only used in one location. Therefore, it should be removed and the event should be emitted directly.

# [N-10] Move borrowBalance function to borrow section instead of view section

Function `borrowBalance` in Ctoken contract is not a view function. It computes the borrow balance with accrued interest. Therefore, it should be placed in the MAIN section of the contract.

# [N-12] Delete unused code for unsorted order book.

# [N-13] Refactor for clear cases:

# [N-14] Float pragma

Yieldly.Finance contracts use the floating pragma ^0.8.0. Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using another pragma, for example, either an outdated pragma version that might introduce bugs that affect the contract system negatively or a recently released pragma version which has not been extensively tested.
