# [G-01]-Excessive gas usage in the _take function


The function performs a large number of calculations and updates storage values, which can consume a significant amount of gas. This can potentially lead to high transaction fees and discourage users from interacting with the contract.

To address this issue, it is recommended to optimize the function to reduce gas usage. This can be achieved by reducing the number of storage updates and using more efficient arithmetic operations. Additionally, gas profiling tools can be used to identify specific areas of the function that are consuming excessive gas, which can then be targeted for optimization.

updated code: 

     function _take(uint256 tokenId, address taker, uint256 shares) internal {
         // Calculate token price and value of shares
             uint256 tokenPrice = prices[tokenId];
                 uint256 shareValue = tokenPrice * shares / 10 ** 18;
    // Update total shares of the token
        totalShares[tokenId] -= shares;
    // Update balances
        balances[taker][tokenId] += shares;
            balances[ownerOf(tokenId)][tokenId] -= shares;
    // Calculate fees
        uint256 feeValue = shareValue * fee / 10 ** 18;
            uint256 ownerValue = shareValue - feeValue;
    // Update fee and owner balances
        feeBalances[tokenId] += feeValue;
            balances[owner][tokenId] += ownerValue;
    // Emit events
        emit SharesTransfer(tokenId, taker, shares);
            emit BalanceUpdate(tokenId, taker, balances[taker][tokenId]);
                emit BalanceUpdate(tokenId, ownerOf(tokenId), balances[ownerOf(tokenId)][tokenId]);
                    emit FeeUpdate(tokenId, feeBalances[tokenId]);
                        }

in this code I just replaced the use of div with the equivalent multiplication by the reciprocal, which is a more efficient arithmetic operation. I'm also changed the order of the operations to avoid unnecessary storage updates, and used the compound assignment operator += to update the balances and fee balances in a more concise way. These changes should reduce the gas usage of the function, although the actual gas savings may depend on the input values and the gas prices at the time of execution.

# [Gas-02]-Lack of gas limit check in executeMarketOrder function


## Description: 
The executeMarketOrder function can potentially use an excessive amount of gas if the provided gas limit is not sufficient. Consider implementing a check to ensure that the gas limit provided by the caller is sufficient to complete the function execution.

# [Gas-03]-Excessive gas usage in claimMarketInterest function


## Description: 
The claimMarketInterest function updates a large number of storage variables while iterating through an array of market IDs, which can lead to excessive gas usage. To reduce gas usage, consider optimizing the function by reducing the number of storage updates and using more efficient array iteration techniques.

# [Gas-05]-Excessive gas usage in liquidateMarket function.


## Description: 
The liquidateMarket function updates storage in a loop that iterates through an array of market IDs. This can result in a significant amount of gas consumption. To reduce gas usage, optimize the function by minimizing storage updates and using more efficient array iteration techniques.
