### Low/Non-Critical Risk Finding: Unnecessary 'bump' Function

## Issue

The 'bump' function in the RubiconMarket.sol contract does not seem to serve any practical purpose in the current state of the code.

## Code Snippet

```
function bump(bytes32 id_) external can_buy(uint256(id_)) {
    uint256 id = uint256(id_);
    /// TODO: double check it is sound logic to kill this event
    /// emit LogBump(
    ///     id_,
    ///     keccak256(abi.encodePacked(offers[id].pay_gem, offers[id].buy_gem)),
    ///     offers[id].owner,
    ///     offers[id].pay_gem,
    ///     offers[id].buy_gem,
    ///     uint128(offers[id].pay_amt),
    ///     uint128(offers[id].buy_amt),
    ///     offers[id].timestamp
    /// );
}

```

## Analysis
The 'bump' function receives a bytes32 input, checks if the id_ can buy, and then converts the id_ to uint256. However, the function does not return any value or perform any state changes. The event emission is commented out, which further diminishes the function's usefulness.

## Recommendation
Evaluate the necessity of the 'bump' function in the context of the overall system. If the function is not used or referenced elsewhere in the code, consider removing or refactoring it to serve a practical purpose. If the event emission is required, uncomment it and ensure it serves its intended purpose.
