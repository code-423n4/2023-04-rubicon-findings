# 1: LOCK PRAGMAS TO SPECIFIC COMPILER VERSION

Vulnerability details

## Context:

Pragma statements can be allowed to float when a contract is intended for consumption by other developers, as in the case of contracts in a library or EthPM package. Otherwise, the developer would need to manually update the pragma in order to compile locally.

For reference, see https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-103

# 2: FOR MODERN AND MORE READABLE CODE; UPDATE IMPORT USAGE

Vulnerability details

## Context:

Solidity code is also cleaner in another way that might not be noticeable: the struct Point. We were importing it previously with global import but not using it. The Point struct polluted the source code with an unnecessary object we were not using because we did not need it.
This was breaking the rule of modularity and modular programming: only import what you need Specific imports with curly braces to allow us to apply this rule better.
