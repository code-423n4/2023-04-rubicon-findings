# 1: LOCK PRAGMAS TO SPECIFIC COMPILER VERSION

Vulnerability details

## Context:

Pragma statements can be allowed to float when a contract is intended for consumption by other developers, as in the case of contracts in a library or EthPM package. Otherwise, the developer would need to manually update the pragma in order to compile locally.

For reference, see https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-103

# 2: FOR MODERN AND MORE READABLE CODE; UPDATE IMPORT USAGE

Vulnerability details

## Context:

Solidity code is also cleaner in another way that might not be noticeable: the struct Point. We were importing it previously with global import but not using it. The Point struct polluted the source code with an unnecessary object we were not using because we did not need it.
This was breaking the rule of modularity and modular programming: only import what you need Specific imports with curly braces to allow us to apply this rule better.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

import {contract1 , contract2} from "filename.sol";

#### Example:

import {Owned} from "solmate/auth/Owned.sol";
import {ERC721} from "solmate/tokens/ERC721.sol";
import {LibString} from "solmate/utils/LibString.sol";
import {MerkleProofLib} from "solmate/utils/MerkleProofLib.sol";
import {FixedPointMathLib} from "solmate/utils/FixedPointMathLib.sol";
import {ERC1155, ERC1155TokenReceiver} from "solmate/tokens/ERC1155.sol";
import {toWadUnsafe, toDaysWadUnsafe} from "solmate/utils/SignedWadMath.sol";

# 3: USE UNDERSCORES FOR NUMBER LITERALS

Vulnerability details

## Impact:

There are occasions where certain numbers have been hardcoded, either in variables or in the code itself. Large numbers can become hard to read.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider using underscores for number literals to improve their readability.

# 4: INTERCHANGEABLE USAGE OF UINT AND UINT256

Vulnerability details

## Context:

Interchangeable usage of uint and uint256. Below are instances where uint was used rather than uint256 like in the rest of the code.
