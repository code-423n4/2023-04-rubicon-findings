In the buy function of SimpleMarket contract, since quantity comes as parameter of the function, it is better to perform validations on them first before running other computations.

So, before attempting to compute spend, check if spend is uint128 and greater than 0. This is applicable to cases where the conditions does not hold true and function reverts. Some computational effort and gas can be saved here.

 function buy(
        uint256 id,
        uint256 quantity
    ) public virtual can_buy(id) synchronized returns (bool) {
        OfferInfo memory _offer = offers[id];
        uint256 spend = mul(quantity, _offer.buy_amt) / _offer.pay_amt;

        require(uint128(spend) == spend, "spend is not an int");
        require(uint128(quantity) == quantity, "quantity is not an int");
