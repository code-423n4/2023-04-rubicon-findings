At the beginning of the function, it is required that the value for _span[pay_gem][buy_gem] be greater than 0
```solidity
  - _span[pay_gem][buy_gem]--;
  + unchecked{ _span[pay_gem][buy_gem]--;}
```

The require statement is best placed at the beginning of the function for optimal performance
```solidity
    function _hide(
        uint256 id //id of maker offer to remove from unsorted list
    ) internal returns (bool) {
      + require(!isOfferSorted(id), "offer sorted"); //make sure offer id is not in sorted offers list
        uint256 uid = _head; //id of an offer in unsorted offers list
        uint256 pre = uid; //id of previous offer in unsorted offers list

      - require(!isOfferSorted(id), "offer sorted"); //make sure offer id is not in sorted offers list
```

This code can be optimized by simplifying the if/else statement,avoids using unnecessary conditional branches and makes the code more clear and concise

```solidity
function isAuthorized(address src) internal view returns (bool) {
  return src == owner;
}
```

getOffer should verify whether the offer is currently active
```solidity
  function getOffer(
      uint256 id
  ) public view returns (uint256, ERC20, uint256, ERC20) {
    + require(isActive(id));
      OfferInfo memory _offer = offers[id];
      return (_offer.pay_amt, _offer.pay_gem, _offer.buy_amt, _offer.buy_gem);
  }
```
