# Use a more descriptive variable name for the following, the would help someone reading the code better understand the intention for them:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L636-L640
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L644L646

# Use consistent require string conventions:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/utilities/poolsUtility/Position.sol#L116 -  uses "sellAllAmountWithLeverage: FAILED TO OPEN POSITION"
Where as https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/utilities/poolsUtility/Position.sol#L212 - uses "closePosition: POS ISN'T ACTIVE" (shortening position to pos), choose one convention and stick with it

# Spelling mistakes:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/utilities/poolsUtility/Position.sol#L593 - INVLAID should be INVALID
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/utilities/poolsUtility/Position.sol#L597 - INVLAID should be INVALID
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/BathHouseV2.sol#L70 - "createBathToken: BATHTOKEN WITH THIS ERC20 EXIST ALDREADY" should be "createBathToken: BATHTOKEN WITH THIS ERC20 EXIST ALREADY"

# Lots of commented out code that isn't used in the following file, if it isn't needed then remove it:

# For functions, follow solidity standard naming conventions
Functions should be grouped according to their visibility and ordered:

1)constructor
2)receive function (if exists)
3)fallback function (if exists)
4)external
5)public
6)internal
7)private
