## Low Risk Issues

# [L-01] Front-runable Initializer

There is nothing preventing another account from calling the `initializer` before the contract owner. In the best case, the owner is forced to waste gas and re-deploy. In the worst case, the owner does not notice that his/her call reverts, and everyone starts using a contract under the control of an attacker.

# [L-02] Return value from `transfer`, `transferFrom` and `approval` is ignored

Not all IERC20 implementations revert() when thereâ€™s a failure in the `approve()`, `transfer()` or `transferFrom()`. The function signature has a boolean return value and they indicate errors that way instead. By not checking the return value, operations that should have marked as failed, may potentially go through without actually approving anything.

        /// @dev v2 bathTokens shouldn't be sent to this contract from anywhere other than this function
        IERC20(bathTokenV2).transfer

# [L-03] Input Validation not done

Input should be properly validated to ensure correct behaviour. The address `token` should be checked for `address(0)`.
