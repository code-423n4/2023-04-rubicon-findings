**[L-01] Add constructor initializers**

As per [OpenZeppelin’s (OZ) recommendation](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/uupsupgradeable-vulnerability-post-mortem/15680/6), “The guidelines are now to make it impossible for *anyone* to run `initialize` on an implementation contract, by adding an empty constructor with the `initializer` modifier. So the implementation contract gets initialized automatically upon deployment.”

Note that this behaviour is also incorporated the [OZ Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/) since the UUPS vulnerability discovery: “Additionally, we modified the code generated by the [Wizard 19](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/) to include a constructor that automatically initializes the implementation when deployed.”

Furthermore, this thwarts any attempts to frontrun the initialization tx of these contracts:
```
File: contracts/BathHouseV2.sol
32:    function initialize(address _comptroller, address _pAdmin) external {
```
```
File: contracts/RubiconMarket.sol
700:    function initialize(address _feeTo) public {
```

**[L-02] Input array lengths may differ**
If the caller makes a copy-paste error, the lengths may be mismatchd and an operation believed to have been completed may not in fact have been completed
```
File: contracts/RubiconMarket.sol
887:    function batchOffer(

```
```
File: contracts/RubiconMarket.sol
910:    function batchCancel(uint[] calldata ids) external {

```
```
File: contracts/RubiconMarket.sol
917:    function batchRequote(

```

**[L-03] Missing checks for address(0x0) when assigning values to address state variables**
```
File: contracts/RubiconMarket.sol
533:        info.owner = owner;
```

**[L-04] FRONT-RUNNABLE INITIALIZERS**
By front-running the contract deployers to initialize the contract, the incorrect parameters may be supplied, leaving the contract needing to be redeployed.
```
File: contracts/BathHouseV2.sol
32:    function initialize(address _comptroller, address _pAdmin) external {
```
```
File: contracts/RubiconMarket.sol
700:    function initialize(address _feeTo) public {
```

**[N-01]Avoid floating pragmas: the version should be locked**
```
File: contracts/RubiconMarket.sol
2:  pragma solidity ^0.8.9;
```
