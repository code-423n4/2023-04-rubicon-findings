**[L] Add constructor initializers**

As per [OpenZeppelin’s (OZ) recommendation](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/uupsupgradeable-vulnerability-post-mortem/15680/6), “The guidelines are now to make it impossible for *anyone* to run `initialize` on an implementation contract, by adding an empty constructor with the `initializer` modifier. So the implementation contract gets initialized automatically upon deployment.”

Note that this behaviour is also incorporated the [OZ Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/) since the UUPS vulnerability discovery: “Additionally, we modified the code generated by the [Wizard 19](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/) to include a constructor that automatically initializes the implementation when deployed.”

Furthermore, this thwarts any attempts to frontrun the initialization tx of these contracts:
```
contracts/BathHouseV2.sol
32:    function initialize(address _comptroller, address _pAdmin) external {
```
