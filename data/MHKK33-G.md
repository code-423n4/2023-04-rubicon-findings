It could be made in this smart contract is by using the immutable keyword for the Comptroller and BathBuddy contracts, since they are not expected to change throughout the lifetime of the contract.

By marking these contracts as immutable, Solidity compiler will treat them as constants and can optimize the bytecode to save on gas costs during deployment and function calls.
Like in this example code,


contract BathHouseV2 {
    // Mark Comptroller and BathBuddy contracts as immutable
    immutable Comptroller public comptroller;
    immutable BathBuddy public bathBuddy;
    
    // rest of the contract implementation
    // ...
    
    constructor(address _comptroller, address _bathBuddy) {
        comptroller = Comptroller(_comptroller);
        bathBuddy = BathBuddy(_bathBuddy);
    }
}



In the above example, Comptroller and BathBuddy contracts are marked as immutable and initialized in the constructor using their addresses passed as parameters. The use of immutable keyword also makes the contract safer since it ensures that the referenced contracts cannot be changed after deployment.
