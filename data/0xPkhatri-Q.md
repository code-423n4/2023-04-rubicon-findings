[L-02] Upon reviewing the bump function, it appears to be non-functional, as it does not perform any meaningful operations. The entire function is essentially a no-op, with the only actions being the conversion of id_ to uint256 and the commented-out event emission. This could be the result of an incomplete implementation or unnecessary code. It is advised to either complete the intended functionality or remove this function entirely to reduce confusion and potential security risks.

[L-03] isClosed() function always return false look like missing logic.
