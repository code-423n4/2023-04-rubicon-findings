1)Use SafeERC20 functions: Use SafeERC20.safeApprove() and SafeERC20.safeTransfer() when interacting with ERC20 tokens to save gas and mitigate potential vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks. For example, replace underlying.approve(bathTokenV2, amountWithdrawn) with SafeERC20.safeApprove(underlying, bathTokenV2, amountWithdrawn).

2)Simplify event emission: Instead of using address(bathTokenV1) and address(bathTokenV2) in the emit Migrated() event, directly use msg.sender and bathTokenV2 to emit the event, which can help simplify the code and save gas.

3)Verify return values: Make sure to verify the return values of functions like CErc20Interface(bathTokenV2).mint(amountWithdrawn) to ensure that they match the expected values. Depending on the implementation of CErc20Interface, you may be able to optimize the return value checks to reduce gas usage.
