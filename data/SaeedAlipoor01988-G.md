## ++i/i++ should be unchecked{++i}/unchecked{i++} when it is not possible for them to overflow, as is the case when used in for- and while-loops
The risk of for loops getting overflowed is extremely low. Because it always increments by 1 and is limited to the arrays length. Even if the arrays are extremely long, it will take a massive amount of time and gas to let the for loop overflow.

The unchecked keyword is new in solidity version 0.8.0, so this only applies to that version or higher, which these instances are.

## With assembly, .call (bool success) transfer can be done gas-optimized
return data (bool success,) has to be stored due to EVM architecture, but in a usage like below, ‘out’ and ‘outsize’ values are given (0,0), this storage disappears and gas optimization is provided.

## Setting the constructor to payable
You can cut out 10 opcodes in the creation-time EVM bytecode if you declare a constructor payable. Making the constructor payable eliminates the need for an initial check of msg.value == 0 and saves 13 gas on deployment with no security risks.

## Multiple address/ID mappings can be combined into a single mapping of an address/ID to a struct, where appropriate
Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (20000 gas) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save ~42 gas per access due to not having to recalculate the key’s keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation’s associated stack operations.

## use STORAGE keyword instead of memory when creating new struct instance

method 1 MEMORY :

    load full User struct from storage (2 sloads)
    store User struct in memory (mstore)
    load user.isActive from memory (mload), store on stack
    load user.userAge from memory (mload), store on stack

method 1 STORAGE :

    store storage pointer user (stack)
    load user.isActive (sload), store on stack
    load user.userAge (sload), store on stack

## Add unchecked {} for subtractions where the operands cannot underflow because of a previous require() or if-statement

require(a <= b); x = b - a => require(a <= b); unchecked { x = b - a }.
