## Gas Optimizations

| [GAS-1](#GAS-1) | Use multiple require instead of && | 3 |
### <a name="GAS-1"></a>[GAS-1] Use multiple require instead of &&
Instead of chaining the conditions in one require (&&),split into multiple require will save gas (saving 3 gas perÂ &).  
Though it costs more gas on deployment, it will end being cheaper with enough runtime calls.
