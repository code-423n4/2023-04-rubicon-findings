# Owner Can Renounce Ownership

# Description
The `renounceOwnership()` function in the `Position` contract allows the owner to renounce their ownership of the contract without assigning a new owner. This can be a security issue, as it means that the contract may be left without an owner or control in case of a compromise of the owner's account or key.



# POC
```python
>>> owner
<Account '0x66aB6D9362d4F35596279692F0251Db635165871'>
>>> position.owner()
'0x66aB6D9362d4F35596279692F0251Db635165871'
>>> position.renounceOwnership({'from': owner})

# Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, it's recommended to either implement a two-factor authentication process for transferring ownership or to modify the `renounceOwnership()` function to overwrite it so that it's not possible to call it directly. This could be done by removing the function or implementing a check that prevents it from being called if there are no other owners designated.

## Two Factor Authentication Example
In this example, the owner must specify a new owner address and the new owner must confirm the ownership transfer before the transfer can occur. This ensures that ownership can only be transferred with the approval of both the current and new owners.

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TwoFactorAuthOwnership {
    address public owner;
    address public proposal;

    event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(_newOwner != address(0), "Invalid new owner address");
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");

        proposal = _newOwner;
    }

    function confirmOwnershipTransfer() public {
        require(msg.sender == proposal, "Only the new owner can confirm ownership transfer");

        // Emit ownership transfer event
        emit OwnershipTransferred(owner, proposal);

        // Set new owner
        owner = proposal;
    }
}
```

## Overwriting `renonuceOwnership()` Example

In this example, the `renounceOwnership()` function is overwritten to prevent the owner from renouncing ownership without transferring ownership to a new address.

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract NoRenounceOwnership is Ownable {
    address public newOwner;

    event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);

    function renounceOwnership() public override onlyOwner {
        revert("Ownership cannot be renounced, please transfer ownership to a new address.");
    }
}
```
