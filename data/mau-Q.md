# Comments
The Ownable contract in OpenZeppelin provides several advantages over creating an access control system from scratch, including:

**Security**: OpenZeppelin is a well-audited and tested library of smart contracts, which reduces the risk of vulnerabilities and errors in the code. The Ownable contract provides a secure way to manage access control in your smart contract.

**Time-saving**: The Ownable contract can save a lot of time and effort in writing and testing access control functionalities. Instead of writing your own code, you can use the pre-built contract provided by OpenZeppelin and focus on other aspects of your smart contract.

**Standardization**: OpenZeppelin provides a standard interface for access control, which makes it easier for other developers to understand and interact with your smart contract. By using the Ownable contract, you can benefit from the well-established conventions and best practices in the Ethereum community.

**Flexibility**: The Ownable contract can be customized to fit your specific needs. You can modify the contract to add or remove access control functionalities as per your requirements.

Overall, using the Ownable contract from OpenZeppelin can provide several benefits over creating an access control system from scratch, including security, time-saving, standardization, and flexibility.
