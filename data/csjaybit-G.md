Making constant variables private will save gas during deployment
When constants are marked public, extra getter functions are created, increasing the deployment cost. Marking these functions private will decrease gas cost. One can still read these variables through the source code. If they need to be accessed by an external contract, a separate single getter function can be used to return all constants as a tuple. There are three instances of public constants.
