# Struct packing can be used here:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/utilities/FeeWrapper.sol#L12
struct CallParams {
    bytes4 selector; // function selector
    bytes args; // encoded arguments (abi.encode() || abi.encodePacked)
    address target; // target contract to call
    FeeParams feeParams;
}

can be re-arranged to:
struct CallParams {
    bytes4 selector; // function selector
    address target; // target contract to call
    bytes args; // encoded arguments (abi.encode() || abi.encodePacked)
    FeeParams feeParams;
}

since storage slots in soldity are 32 bytes long, and an address is 20 bytes and bytes4 is 4 bytes, both selector and target can be stored in the same slot saving gas
wheres https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/utilities/FeeWrapper.sol#L12 would have each selector which is 4 bytes taking up an entire 32byte storage slot

# Can remove if else and save gas for this function
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L35
This function can be made into a one liner and saves gas over the unneeded if else condition:
function isAuthorized(address src) internal view returns (bool) {
  return src == owner
}


# isClosed always returns false
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L620
This function always returns false and is checked in the following places:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L722
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L605
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L614
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/main/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L598
If it's never closed (i.e. always returns false) then this check should be removed to save gas.
